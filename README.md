# Star Wars Game

This browser RPG game is themed around the Star Wars series and its characters.

## Getting Started

1. Select any character from the first deck to begin. A character can only be selected when the "Select" button is visible under its card.
2. After selecting your main character, all other characters will be moved to the Enemies deck. 
3. Select any character from the Enemies deck to designate a Defender. Your main character can then start fighting the Defender.
4. To attack the Defender, use the "Attack" button located between the Enemies and Defender decks.
5. When attacking the Defender, your main character accrues more attack points. 
6. If you character runs out of life points, the game ends. You have been defeated. 
7. When your character defeats the current Defender, the game continues with the selection of a new character to fight.
8. After selecting a new character from the Enemies deck, the game continues. 
9. The game is won when all Enemies have been defeated. When an enemy is defeated, its character card disapears.
